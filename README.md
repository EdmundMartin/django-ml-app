# Automating Data Science

This django project has multiple apps:

* regml - regression problem
* classml - classification problem
* clustml - clustering problem
* superml - deep learning problem

The end goal of this web app is to be able to analyse supplied dataset and recommend the best ML model out of the most commonly used. It would all depend on your ML problem.
This tool will perform any data preprocessing needed - data cleaning, feature extraction, normalisation, etc etc. It will visualise the data and look at the relationship between the features. It will be able to deal with numeric, categorical and datetime features separately with very little input from the end user.
Doesn't this sound exciting?

This project is currently in development.
